h1. Distinguishable Gray Balls plugin for "Jenkins":http://jenkins-ci.org

Adds different icons for Disabled and Aborted jobs because the default Jenkins icons don't differentiate between Not Built, Disabled and Aborted.

Forked from Jenkins "Green Balls plug-in":https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Green+Balls

This plug-in is compatible with *both* blue and green ball icons
